# Ridership-Model
Notebooks and Python scripts for running the neural network ridership model.

## Python Notebooks
The notebooks were developed in the initial stages of the project and demonstrate the initial functionality and results obtained.
These were created in a hackathon manner in which the team had a short period of time to create something useful.

* Projections_LHS is the neural network model.
* Ridership_Model_NN is the testing suite for the neural network.
* Linear_Model_Testing is the suite for testing various linear models.
* 'Interactive' notebooks can be used to play around with various explanatory variables and see their effect on boardings.

## Python Scripts
The scripts were developed following the first phase of the project as we were instructed to continue working after sharing results from the notebooks.

* data-exploration is a file in which feature engineering and variable reduction is tested.
* lhs-generate is for testing the latin hypercube sampling data generation.
* nn-model-test is where I tested variations to the model to select model parameters.
* nn-model is for generating and saving a desired model.
